                        <li>You can increase your commission ratio by bringing on new Sub-agents to your team, which
                            will increase your weekly earnings! </li>
                        <li>You can invite other agents who wish to work with Chamet and receive their own dashboard by
                            sending them your link once you've created your own dashboard on Chamet and become an
                            official Chamet agent.</li>

                        <h1 id="chamet">Who are Chamet SubAgents ?</h1>
                        <li>All other agents that you invite to join Chamet as an agency using your invitation link are
                            your Chamet SubAgents. since each new agent needs to be invited by an existing agent. Thus,
                            you act as his Upper Agent (or mentor) and he acts as your sub-agent when you invite a new
                            Chamet Agent.</li>
                        <li>Like you, your subAgent receives payment directly from Chamet, has his own dashboard, and
                            independently oversees his team. </li>
                        <li>What are the advantages for you?</li>
                        <li>Recall that the total revenue your hosts and sub-agents in your agency generate determines
                            your commission ratio as an agent.</li>
                        <li><i>TOTAL REVENUE OF AGENCY =
                                ( REVENUE OF HOSTS + REVENUE OF SUB-AGENTS )</i></li>
                        <li>Your commission ratio % will be determined each week depending on the total revenue of your
                            agency.</li>

                        <li class="example">Example :</li>
                        <li>Assume you have four subagents.</li>
                        <li>With a total income of $1,500, the first sub-agent has a 15% ratio.</li>
                        <li>With a 500$ income, the second person's ratio is 10%. </li>
                        <li>Since the third person makes $500, his ratio is 10%.</li>
                        <li>With an income of $5,000, the Forth individual's ratio is 20%.</li>
                        <li>Furthermore, suppose you only have sub-agents instead of hosts. The computation of your
                            commission is as follows: </li>
                        <br>
                        <li class="example2">Your ratio is 20% since the total revenue for you and your subagents is
                            1.500+500+500+5.000=7.500$. Then, each sub-agent will pay you a commission that looks like
                            this: </li>
                        <li>First sub-agent: 15% - 20% = 5% x 1500 = 75 $, </li>
                        <li>The Second : 20% - 10% = 10% x 500=50$. </li>
                        <li>The Third : 20% - 10% = 10% x 500=50$.</li>
                        <li>The Fourth : 20% - 20% = 0$, no commission from him.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li class="example3">Thus, in total, you will have 75+50+50+0= 175$ commission only from your 4
                            sub-agents.</li>
                        <li class="example3">Since we previously discussed, your current commission ratio is 20% if you
                            also have direct hosts who made $1500. Consequently, you will receive a commission of $1500
                            x 20% = $300 from your host.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li style="background-color: rgb(213, 255, 209); list-style: none;">Your revenue will grow by
                            increasing the number of sub-agents, which is Chamet most significant feature.</li>
